# Optimizing-Social-Media-Ad-Campaign-Performance
As a Data Analyst, a consumer goods company launching its flagship product line, The Task is conducting a comprehensive analysis of social media advertising campaigns. Your role is to translate raw campaign data into actionable insights that will help the marketing team understand channel performance, audience engagement, and cost efficiency.

Problem Statement
Primary Challenge: TrendWave lacks a comprehensive performance analysis framework to evaluate social media channels, quantify the impact of ad spend on conversions, and optimize targeting strategies. This gap results in suboptimal ROI and missed growth opportunities.

Key Questions to Address
Which age and gender groups are responsible for the highest sales and ad spend, and how does their conversion efficiency compare?
How effective is the campaign in converting impressions into clicks and clicks into sales, as demonstrated by CTR (Click Through Rate) and conversion rate?
Are there significant differences in Cost per Action (CPA) and Cost per Mille (CPM) between different demographic segments, and what does this imply for budget optimization?


Calculations Used - 

-- CPM (Cost Per Mille)
CPM: ([Spent] / [Impressions]) * 1000

-- CPC (Cost Per Click)  
CPC: [Spent] / [Clicks]

-- CTR (Click Through Rate)
CTR: ([Clicks] / [Impressions]) * 100

-- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
CPA: [Spent] / [Approved Conversion]

-- Conversion Rate
Conversion Rate: ([Approved Conversion] / [Clicks]) * 100

-- ROI (assuming $50 average order value)
ROI: (([Approved Conversion] * 50) - [Spent]) / [Spent] * 100

-- Total Revenue (assuming $50 AOV)
Total Revenue: [Approved Conversion] * 50

-- Profit
Profit: [Total Revenue] - [Spent]

-- Efficiency Score (Conversions per $1000 spent)
Efficiency Score: ([Approved Conversion] / [Spent]) * 1000
